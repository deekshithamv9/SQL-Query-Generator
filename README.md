# SQL Query Generator

## Project Overview

The **SQL Query Generator** is a Streamlit + Flask-based web application that converts **natural language text** into **SQL queries** and executes them on a relational database. It is designed to help beginners, developers, and interview candidates understand SQL queries easily. The system also provides explanations for the queries in simple terms.

The application includes:

* Interactive **database explorer** (view DB, tables, and columns).
* **Text-to-SQL conversion** using Gemini AI.
* Query **execution and output display**.
* Short **query explanation** for better understanding.

---

## Features

* **Natural Language to SQL**: Convert plain English into SQL queries.
* **Database Explorer**: Visualize database, tables, and fields on the left panel.
* **One-click Copy**: Copy AI-generated SQL queries easily.
* **Query Execution**: Run SQL queries directly and display results in the UI.
* **AI Explanation**: Understand the query in simple English.
* **JOINs and Aggregates**: Supports complex SQL queries like joins, group by, and filters.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

### Backend

* **Flask** → REST API for DB connection and query execution.
* **MySQL** → Relational database (Employee Management System).
* **SQLAlchemy** → ORM and database handling.
* **Google Gemini AI API** → Convert English text into SQL queries.

### Frontend

* **Streamlit** → Interactive UI for text input, results, and DB explorer.
* **Pandas** → For displaying query results in tabular format.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* pip package manager
* GitHub account
* Google Gemini API key

### Steps

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deekshithamv9/SQL-Query-Generator.git
   cd SQL-Query-Generator
   ```

2. **Setup virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # (Linux/Mac)
   .venv\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file inside the root folder:

   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://user:password@localhost/employee_management
   ```

5. **Run Backend (Flask)**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Run Frontend (Streamlit)**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## How to Run the Project

1. Start Flask backend → connects to DB.
2. Run Streamlit frontend → open UI in browser.
3. Enter English text → see generated SQL query → execute → view results and explanation.

---

## Example Queries

* "List all employees who joined after 2022."
* "Find employees working in Engineering department and their projects."
* "Get employees and their manager names."
* "Show projects with no employees assigned."
* "List departments with average salary greater than 50,000."

---

## API Routes

* `POST /generate-sql` → Converts natural language to SQL.
* `POST /execute-sql` → Executes SQL query and returns results.
* `GET /db-schema` → Returns DB tables and fields.
